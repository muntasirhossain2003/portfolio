                <p>
                  I started programming during my early university days when I
                  became interested in solving problems through technology. I
                  have developed several applications focusing on different
                  areas including environmental issues, education systems, and
                  AI integration.
                </p>

                  My technical skills include programming languages like
                  JavaScript, Python, Java, and C++. I work with web
                  technologies such as React and Node.js, and I have experience
                  with mobile development using React Native. I also work with
                  various databases and cloud platforms.

                  I am currently in my undergraduate program at IUT, where I
                  balance my coursework with personal projects. I participate in

              <p>
                I am pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and

                covers fundamental areas like algorithms, data structures,
                software engineering, and database systems.
              </p>

              <p>
                I have taken courses in artificial intelligence, machine
                learning, and web development. These subjects have helped me
                understand both theoretical concepts and practical
                implementation techniques that I apply in my personal projects.
              </p>

              <p>
                Apart from regular classes, I participate in coding
                competitions, attend tech events, and work on collaborative
                projects with fellow students. These activities help me stay
                updated with current technologies and improve my problem-solving
                abilities.
